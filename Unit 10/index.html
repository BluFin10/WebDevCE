<h2>Flyman History</h2>
<p>Flyman Vacations was founded in 2008 by lifelong traveler and aviation enthusiast John Flyman,
     who set out to make travel planning as enjoyable as the journey itself after seeing how impersonal and complicated it could be.
      What began as a small, home-based agency specializing in flight bookings and custom itineraries quickly grew through word of mouth into a trusted travel company
       offering full vacation packages, cruises, and guided international tours. Today, Flyman Vacations continues to combine modern booking technology with personalized
        service, staying true to its original mission of helping travelers explore the world with confidence and ease.
